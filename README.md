# Backend of the (experimental) machine learning method identifing box turtle individuals from digital image

This is part of the [quantitative turtle analysis project](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eesc/science/quantitative-turtle-analysis-project-machine-learning-turtles) (QTAP). 

We aim to provide a easily accessible interface for ecologists to apply such methods without much requirement on knowledge of python. The frontend (preview) is a Colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CXc9orAa4uMTWsQ-t0i6E5IiMnbX0bAJ?usp=share_link).
